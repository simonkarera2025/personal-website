            <p>
              My academic journey has played a major role in shaping my career goals.
              I have progressed through different levels of education, gaining
              knowledge, discipline, and problem-solving skills. Currently, I am
              pursuing Software Engineering, where I continue to develop both
              technical and analytical abilities.
