<h2>Domain Name and Web Hosting</h2>

<p>
A domain name is the unique address of a website that users type into a web browser to access a website.
Examples of domain names include www.google.com and www.github.com. A domain name helps users easily
identify and remember a website.

<p>
Web hosting is a service that allows individuals or organizations to store their website files on a server
so that the website can be accessed on the internet. A web hosting provider stores the HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and image files and makes them available to visitors online.

Examples of popular web hosting providers include GitHub Pages, Bluehost, Hostinger, and GoDaddy.
In this project, GitHub can be used to host the website files and make the website accessible online.
